# pokedex-kotlin

Originally created by [Nick Law](https://github.com/nickwlaw/pokedex-kotlin) for a lunch and learn demonstration.
After seeing his demonstration, [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) had just launched in it's v1.0.0 version and I became inspired to try taking a crack at modifying his code to use Compose and then have a similar presentation.
The purpose was to also demonstrate / practice with using Kotlin Flows along with Compose.

Also demonstrating Coil over Glide.

As this was a first attempt at Compose, and I was trying to make as few changes to Nick's original code as possible; it's still using a hybrid model with Fragments rather than swapping the Composables straight from the Activity.
